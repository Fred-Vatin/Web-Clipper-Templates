# Web Clipper Templates
My templates for this [extension](https://help.obsidian.md/web-clipper) for [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian).

Just copy the json files content to import in the web clipper.

## Snippets
Don‚Äôt forget to download the snippets that go along with the templates you need.

## About Twitter/ùïè
This template is meant to archive tweet that match the url `https://x.com/some-user/status/tweetID`. It saves tweet and quote, the images and gif but currently can not save the videos. Follow and add a thumb up to this [issue](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/issues/331) to know why and if it is fixed.

This template is currently a workaround because the variable available are not numerous or always right. Follow and add a thumb up to this [issue](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/issues/332) to know why and if it is fixed.

But the result is good.
