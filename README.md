Thread about these templates on the [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/my-web-clipper-templates/95191)

## About Twitter/ùïè
This template is meant to archive tweets that match the url `https://x.com/some-user/status/tweetID`. It saves tweet and quote, the images and gif but currently can not save the videos. Follow and add a thumb up to this [issue](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/issues/331) to know why and if it is fixed.

This template is currently a workaround because the variable available are not numerous or always right. Follow and add a thumb up to this [issue](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/issues/332) to know why and if it is fixed.

But the result is good.
